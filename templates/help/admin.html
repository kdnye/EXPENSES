<h1>Administrator Guide</h1>
<p class="text-muted">
  Manage access, role permissions, and policy alignment so expense reporting stays secure and consistent.
</p>

<h2 id="user-approvals">User approvals and permissions</h2>
<p>
  Administrators control who can access the portal and what each user can do.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Employee</strong>: create, edit, and submit personal expense reports.</li>
  <li><strong>Supervisor</strong>: review assigned reports and approve or reject with comments.</li>
  <li><strong>Administrator</strong>: manage users, permissions, and platform settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  During account approval, verify contact details, assign the correct role, and require strong passwords.
</p>

<h2 id="policy-controls">Policy controls and settings</h2>
<p>
  Use the settings pages to keep category options, reimbursement rules, and review expectations current.
  When policy updates occur, notify supervisors so approvals remain consistent across teams.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Review expense categories and thresholds on a regular cadence.</li>
  <li>Audit rejected-report comments for recurring issues that indicate policy confusion.</li>
  <li>Deactivate or adjust accounts promptly when employees change teams or leave the company.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="audit-readiness">Audit readiness</h2>
<p>
  Encourage teams to attach clear receipts and complete business-purpose notes. Consistent documentation
  shortens approvals and improves readiness for internal or external audits.
